					<ul>
						<li>On January 2010 I was born in Perth, Australia. My parents say I was quite lively when I was young and often jump around the house like a runaway monkey. I often played with building blocks that my parents brought me making all sorts of fun and interesting things. As I grew older my parents took my education seriously. I would spend hours doing different things like reading letters learn my numbers. When I was four, I moved to Bunbury, a small town around 100km below Perth. The first school I went to was Bunbury Cathedral Grammar school. I was shy and did not have many friends. But I was excellent in my studies. In every class I was the best of the best, scoring high scores in every field. I eventually made two friends named Sanchit, and Tom. I was pretty bored around the house but then I had a brother named Harish. I stayed in Bunbury Cathedral Grammar school until the summer holiday before 1st grade.<br><br> Then I moved to another school by the name of Bunbury Primary School. There, I met a lot of new people, including one of my mom's friend's daughters. I stayed in that school until the middle of second grade. Then my dad got a job in Saudi Arabia, a country I had never heard of until now. My dad spent six months there before my mom, me ,and my brother could move there as well. The trip took almost 7 hours by plane, and when arrived there, it was like I was opening up to a whole new world. The drive from the airport to our new house took about an hour, and most of the scenery was a desert. Since I had arrived here in the middle of the summer, there was no school. About a week after I landed in Saudi, I met two friends. Their names were Abhi, and Aarush and they were brothers.<br><br> I eventually started my education at a new school named B.I.S.A.K (British International School Of Al Khobar). I was doing very well in school and made lots of friends there. I have won many awards like my first prize in the gifted group science competition. That brings us to where I am now. I am about to start sixth grade and I can wait for what unfolds in my exciting life. </li>
